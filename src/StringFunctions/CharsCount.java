Splitting: "Prachi Priya" â†’ ["P", "r", "a", "c", "h", "i", " ", "P", "r", "i", "y", "a"]

Stream: Stream is created from the array of characters.

Grouping: The stream is grouped by each character.

Counting: The count of each character is calculated.

Result: A map is produced with characters as keys and counts as values.
